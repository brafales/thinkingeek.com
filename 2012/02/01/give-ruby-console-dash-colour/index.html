  <title>Give your Ruby console a dash of colour</title>
  <meta name="description" content="When you&#39;re developing an application in Rails (or Ruby), you spend lots of time in the IRB, the Interactive Ruby Shell. Usually just to test some Ruby code, start an application console or debug something going on inside the project. Yesterday, looking at a coworker screen, I saw he had his console with lots of color hints, and I thought it was pretty nice. I asked him about that and he told me he was using a special gem for that. The gem is called wirble. It has some nice defaults and allows you to configure the colors as you wish. To use it in your consoles, just add this lines to your ~/.irbrc file: begin require &#39;rubygems&#39; require &#39;wirble&#39; Wirble.init Wirble.colorize rescue LoadError =&amp;gt; err warn &quot;Couldn&#39;t load Wirble: #{err}&quot; end Of course, you&#39;ll need to install the gem. Just issue a gem install wirble and you&#39;ll be good to go!">

    <p>
When you're developing an application in Rails (or Ruby), you spend lots of time in the <em>IRB</em>, the Interactive Ruby Shell. Usually just to test some Ruby code, start an application console or debug something going on inside the project. Yesterday, looking at a coworker screen, I saw he had his console with lots of color hints, and I thought it was pretty nice. I asked him about that and he told me he was using a special gem for that.
</p>
<p>
The gem is called <a href="http://pablotron.org/software/wirble/">wirble</a>. It has some nice defaults and allows you to configure the colors as you wish. To use it in your consoles, just add this lines to your <code>~/.irbrc</code> file:
</p>
<p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">begin</span>
  <span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'rubygems'</span>
  <span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'wirble'</span>
  <span class="no">Wirble</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">init</span>
  <span class="no">Wirble</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">colorize</span>
<span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="no">LoadError</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">err</span>
  <span class="nb">warn</span> <span class="s2">"Couldn't load Wirble: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">err</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

</p>
<p>
Of course, you'll need to install the gem. Just issue a <code>gem install wirble</code> and you'll be good to go!
