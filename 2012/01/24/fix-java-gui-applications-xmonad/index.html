  <title>Fix Java GUI applications in xmonad</title>
  <meta name="description" content="If you ever try to run a GUI Java application when using xmonad as the Window Manager, you&#39;ll probably end up with a nice flat grey window where your buttons, toolbars and other desktop GUI goodies should be. I ran into that problem the other day when trying to evaluate the RubyMine Ruby on Rails IDE from which I heard such good things. After a rather painful installation of the official Java 6 JDK from Oracle in Ubuntu Lucid Lynx (which I&#39;ll write about in some other time), I managed to start up RubyMine just to find out I was seeing absolutely nothing on the screen. I Googled a bit and essentially I found out that the problem was with the Java GUI Toolkit rather than RubyMine, because the framework relies on a list of window managers to handle some things, and xmonad is not in that list. So since I was not using OpenJDK, I opted for the setWMName option and added this final line into my xmonad.hs file: xmonad $ defaultConfig { terminal = myTerminal , workspaces = myWorkspaces , keys = keys&#39; , modMask = modMask&#39; , layoutHook = layoutHook&#39; , manageHook = manageHook&#39; , logHook = myLogHook dzenLeftBar &amp;gt;&amp;gt; fadeInactiveLogHook 0xdddddddd , normalBorderColor = colorNormalBorder , focusedBorderColor = colorFocusedBorder , borderWidth = 2 , startupHook = setWMName &quot;LG3D&quot; } Setting the window manager name to LG3D will trick the Java GUI Toolkit and the application will be painted correctly. Enjoy your Java applications with the power of xmonad!">

    <p>
If you ever try to run a GUI Java application when using <a href="http://www.xmonad.org">xmonad</a> as the Window Manager, you'll probably end up with a nice flat grey window where your buttons, toolbars and other desktop GUI goodies should be. I ran into that problem the other day when trying to evaluate the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine Ruby on Rails IDE</a> from which I heard such good things. After a rather painful installation of the official Java 6 JDK from Oracle in Ubuntu Lucid Lynx (which I'll write about in some other time), I managed to start up RubyMine just to find out I was seeing absolutely nothing on the screen.
</p>
<p>
I Googled a bit and essentially I found out that the problem was with the Java GUI Toolkit rather than RubyMine, because <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Frequently_asked_questions#Problems_with_Java_applications.2C_Applet_java_console">the framework relies on a list of window managers to handle some things, and xmonad is not in that list</a>.
</p>
<p>
So since I was not using OpenJDK, I opted for the <code>setWMName</code> option and added this final line into my <code>xmonad.hs</code> file:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">    <span class="n">xmonad</span> <span class="o">$</span> <span class="n">defaultConfig</span>

      <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">workspaces</span>          <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">myWorkspaces</span>
      <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">keys</span>                <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">keys'</span>
