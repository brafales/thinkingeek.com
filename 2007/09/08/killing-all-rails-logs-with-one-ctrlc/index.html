  <title>Killing all rails logs with one Ctrl+C?</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Well, this is my first post after holidays and it won&#39;t be very long. Imagine you are developing a rails application. Usually you have: a terminal with the server to see what petitions are received. a terminal with a tail of development.log to see what happens with the database. a terminal with a tail of test.log if you are testing something. This are a lot of windows... And the other day one friends was very happy and after asking for a while I discovered that the reason was the simple line showed above... With only one Ctrl+C you can kill all this processes :-) script/server &amp;amp; tail -f log/development.log &amp;amp; tail -f log/test.log &amp;amp; tail -f ; jobs -p | awk &#39;{print &quot;kill -2 &quot; $0}&#39; | sh">

    <p>Well, this is my first post after holidays and it won't be very long.</p>

<p>Imagine you are developing a rails application. Usually you have:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>a terminal with the server to see what petitions are received.</li>

	<li> a terminal with a tail of development.log to see what happens with the database.</li>

	<li> a terminal with a tail of test.log if you are testing something.</li>
 </ul>

<p>
This are a <strong>lot</strong> of windows... And the other day one friends was very happy and after asking for a while I discovered that the reason was the simple line showed above... With only one <strong>Ctrl+C</strong> you can kill all this processes :-)</p>
