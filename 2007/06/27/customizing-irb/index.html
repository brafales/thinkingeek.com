    <p>While developing a Ruby application or while learning ruby, one of the things you must use is IRB (interactive ruby). As in its man page is said "irb is a tool to execute interactively ruby expressions read from stdin.". In this tool you can type and execute directly ruby code. It's very useful but like most other programs like <a href="http://www.vim.org/">ViM</a> (Vi IMproved) the real power is its customization.</p>

<p>Here I post my .irbrc and to make things clear there are some explanations on each line.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1"># autocompletion of methods when pressing TAB</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'irb/completion'</span>
<span class="c1"># Wirble is a plugin to colorize your irb, it's installed from a gem (gem install -y wirble)</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'rubygems'</span>

<span class="no">Wirble</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">colorize</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
As I said before, IRB is very powerful and a proof is that in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby Lang</a> they encourage you to <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">try ruby in your browser</a> with an embedded IRB.
</p>
<p>
Also in rails the console for debugging your application is an irb instance preloaded with all rails configuration. In <a href="http://www.railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a> there is a <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/48">screencast</a> that shows you some tricks about it.
