  <title>Think in Geek!</title>
  <meta name="description" content="What is Think in Geek, you may ask. Well, the obvious answer is simple: a geek blog. We could have named it Yet Another Geek Blog, but we couldn&#39;t find a nice domain for that name (yagb.com sucks hard). And why another geek blog, you may ask too? The answer is another question: why not? Or, if you prefer it: If others have their geek blog, we want one, too! Talking seriously (although what has been said until now it&#39;s true, too), this is a space were we want to simply share our thoughts and knowledge about the geek world in general and the IT world in particular. We simply love those topics, and after having visited thousands of other web places where we have found some interesting tips or solutions to common problems, we though the best way to thank that was precisely to give back what we got to the community. So feel free to enjoy our thoughts, to find answers to problems we&#39;ve already solved before, or simply to know what other people (we and people who want to contribute with comments) thinks about particular things about the geek world.">
