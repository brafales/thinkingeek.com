For some reason, the ArchLinux wiki is kind of outdated explaining how to install xmonad in Arch. Also, the new packages seem to have a bug and the xmonad installation won't work out of the box. Here you have detailed steps on how to install and run xmonad on ArchLinux.
First of all, you need to install the Xorg server. Refer to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg">Xorg</a> for detailed instructions. After that, you'll need to install the xmonad packages, named xmonad and xmonad-contrib.
</p>
<p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">pacman <span class="nt">-Syu</span> xmonad xmonad-contrib</code></pre></figure>

</p>
<p>
This will install xmonad and all the required dependencies. After that, if you want a fairly simple X setup, add the line <em>xmonad</em> to your <em>~/.xinitrc</em> file (hopefully you'll be using a display manager that uses that file like <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Slim">SLiM</a>). If you try this on a freshly installed ArchLinux system, though, it won't work. There are some missing steps to do. First of all, you need to create the folder <em>~/.xmonad</em>.
</p>
<p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">mkdir</span> ~/.xmonad</code></pre></figure>

</p>
<p>
After that, you need to create a new xmonad config file, called <em>xmonad.hs&lt;/em into that folder, so fire up your favourite editor and fill the file with this basic (empty) configuration:
&lt;/p&gt;
<p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nn">XMonad</span>

<span class="n">main</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kr">do</span>
    <span class="n">xmonad</span> <span class="o">$</span> <span class="n">defaultConfig</span></code></pre></figure>

</p>
<p>
Once you have you configuration file in place, it's time to rebuild xmonad:
</p>
<p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">xmonad <span class="nt">--recompile</span></code></pre></figure>

</p>
<p>
And that's all, you should be able to start your fresh new xmonad setup in ArchLinux. By the way, if you wonder why pressing <em>Mod1 + Shift + Enter</em> does nothing, make sure you have the package <em>xterm</em> installed.
</p>
