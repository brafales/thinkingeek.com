          <h2>Registers</h2>

<p>At its core, a processor in a computer is nothing but a powerful calculator. Calculations can only be carried using values stored in very tiny memories called <i>registers</i>. The ARM processor in a Raspberry Pi has 16 integer registers and 32 floating point registers. A processor uses these registers to perform integer computations and floating point computations, respectively. We will put floating registers aside for now and eventually we will get back to them in a future installment. Let’s focus on the integer registers.</p>

In my opinion, it is much more beneficial learning a high level language than a specific architecture assembler. But I fancied learning some ARM assembler just for fun since I know some 386 assembler. The idea is not to become a master but understand some of the details of what happens underneath.

          <p>Some weeks ago the site I work on started having severe outages. It looked like the system was not able to fulfill the incoming requests fast enough, making the passenger queue to grow faster than new requests could be served.</p>

<p>Looking at the rails logs it looked like some Chinese bot was crawling the entire site, including a long list of dynamic pages that took a long time to generate and that are not usually visited. Those pages were not yet cached, so every request went through the rails pipeline. Once you start having the dreadful problem of your passenger queue to grow faster and faster you are usually doomed.</p>

<p>Since you can’t expect some of the malicious bots out there to respect the <code>robots.txt</code> file, I had to filter those requests at the Apache level so they did not even reach the application level. This past few months I’ve been learning a lot of systems administration, basically because it’s us, the developers, who also handle this part of the business.</p>

<p>Since all those requests came from the same <code>user agent</code>, I looked for a simple way to filter the requests based on this criteria. It can be easily done if you use the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_access.html" target="_blank"><code>mod_access</code></a> Apache module. All you need to do is make use of the <code>Allow</code> and <code>Deny</code> directives. Here’s a simple example to filter the <code>ezooms</code> bot:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">&lt;Directory "/home/rails/sites/prod/your_site/current/public"&gt;
    SetEnvIf User-Agent "ezooms" BlockUA
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from env=BlockUA
    Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>What this piece of code does is very self explanatory. The first line tells Apache to set up an environment variable called <code>BlockUA</code> if the <code>user agent</code> of the request matches the “<code>ezooms</code>” string. Then you tell Apache the order it has to evaluate the access control to the directory: it first has to evaluate the <code>Allow</code> directive, and then the <code>Deny</code> one. After that you set up both directives. <code>Allow from all</code> basically allows everything in. <code>Deny from env=BlockUA</code> denies all requests in which the environment variable <code>BlockUA</code> has been set. Since that variable is set up when the <code>user agent</code> matches our desired string, the config will basically deny access to the application to all requests with the “<code>ezooms</code>” user agent.</p>

<p>This way you can easily protect yourself from basic bot attacks.</p>

          <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: make sure you add <code>/usr/local/share/npm/bin</code> to your <code>PATH</code> when installing node.js to be able to access the package binaries.</p>

<p>Developing in Ruby on Rails on a Mountain Lion environment can be a pain. Although it’s a UNIX-like environment, most of the tools created for web development have been made with Linux in mind, and making the switch from a Linux box to Mac OS X is far from harmless.</p>

<p>Anyway, the other day I needed to tweak <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to make the default grid wider, and instead of using the Bootstrap web site customiser, I decided to download the <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap" target="_blank">source code from GitHub</a> and build it myself.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you need <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a> and some of the packages that come with it. I’ve never developed or even played with node.js before, so I needed to install it on the computer. And that was fairly easy thanks to <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" target="_blank">homebrew</a> by simply issuing the command <code>brew install node</code>.</p>

<p>After node has been installed you have access to <code>npm</code>, the node package manager. Following the Bootstrap instructions, I installed the necessary packages:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">npm <span class="nb">install </span>recess connect uglify-js jshint <span class="nt">-g</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After that I thought I was ready to build Bootstrap, but the make command complained about not being able to find some of the node.js binaries I’ve just installed a minute ago.</p>

<p>The solution to the problem, though, was rather simple. It turns out the default formula for nodejs on homebrew doesn’t tell you the folder in which the node.js binaries will be installed in. Without adding this folder to the path, obviously the system can’t find the files it’s supposed to execute.</p>

<p>Simply add the folder <code>/usr/local/share/npm/bin</code> to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable and you’ll be good to go.</p>

          <p class="post-meta">
            Nov 17, 2012• <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Bernat Ràfales</span></span> • <a href="/categories/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a> • <a href="/tags/iterm/">iterm</a>, <a href="/tags/mac-os-x/">mac os x</a>, <a href="/tags/shell/">shell</a></p>

If you use your Mac OS X as a development machine and are a regular user of the shell, chances are you are going to be using the <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/features_7.html" target="_blank">movement commands</a> a lot. Chances are, too, that you are using <a href="http://www.iterm2.com" target="_blank">iTerm</a> instead of the system provided Terminal app.
</p>

<p>
Using the arrow keys is usually enough, but more often than not you need to move between words. This movements, unless you redefine it in your global or local bashrc profile (or any similar shell you maybe using), are done with the keys <code>b</code> and <code>f</code>. Pressing <code>C-b</code> or <code>C-f</code> moves the cursor one character back or forward. Doing if with <code>M-b</code> or <code>M-f</code> does the same but with a word (if you are an Emacs user you will be familiar with those key shortcuts).
</p>

<p>
The <code>C</code> stands for <code>control key</code>, while the <code>M</code> stands for <code>meta key</code>. In most keyboards (or keymaps to be precise), the control key is mapped to the <code>ctrl</code> key and the meta key is mapped to the <code>alt</code> key. In Mac OS X, the meta key is mapped to the <code>alt</code> key, but as you may very well know, this alt key is known as the <code>option</code> key, and has its peculiarities.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you open a shell in iTerm and press <code>C-b</code> or <code>C-f</code>, the output will be as expected, but not if you press <code>M-b</code> or <code>M-f</code>. Instead of moving forward or backward a word, you will see that some weird character is written on the command line.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately this is really easy to fix in iTerm. You just need to go to the Profiles menu, edit your profile (which is most likely to be the default one), and then go to the keys tab. Now, on the bottom of the keymap lists, you will see that you can configure the behaviour of the option key. Set it up to the last option (+Esc) as shown in the screenshot, and then the alt key in iTerm will be sending the shell the adequate escape sequence so all meta mappings work as expected.

<p>
<strong>EDIT (30/11/2012)</strong>: looks like this breaks some of the characters that are used by typing the meta key, i.e. the # character (meta + 3). Another way to achieve what we want is to manually map all the meta key shortcuts. This can be done in the same window as before. Select Normal instead of +Esc and, for each key shortcut you want to map, click on the + button. On the opening dialog, type the combination you want to map, for example alt + d, and select Send escape sequence from the drop down  Then on the last textbox insert the escape sequence character you want to send (typically the same pressed along the meta key).
