          <p>If you've been assigned to a new web application project lately, you'll probably have had to deal with this [not] new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> technology. To be honest, AJAX is good, and websites like <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Google Mail</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> are good examples of that. But remember something: it's always bad to abuse of something. It's always bad to abuse AJAX. Don't use it if it doesn't really make sense to do it, and if your boss insists on it, ask him if he would use truck wheels on his BMW.</p>

          <p>The time when application versions where stored in different folders or in zip files has ended. Today we have great tools like Subversion or CVS. This tools must be known by everybody, but for those who aren't known, they are applications that control versions of files.</p>

<p>While developing a Ruby on Rails application it's good to use a system like Subversion. In this howto I'll explain my experience subversioning my Rails app.</p>

          <p>If you begin to have a lot of computers at home, or even you manage a little LAN on an office, it may come in handy to have a little domain configured. Having a domain configured has some advantages, including easy machine naming and name resolution of those machines. We'll explain here how to setup a little domain with a linux machine and an opensource DHCP and DNS servers.</p>

<p>For this to work you'll need:
<ul>

    	<li>A linux box.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/dhcp/">ISC DHCP Server</a>.</li>

    	<li><a href="http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/bind/">ISC Bind DNS Server</a>.</li>

          <p>Do you like running? The <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?spart=MA365LL%2FB">Nike+Ipod Sports Kit</a> fits perfectly to your needs.</p>
<p>When I bought this gadget some weeks ago I was a bit averse. I didn't believe that this cheap sensor (30€/$) could measure my training accurately. I was wrong.</p>
<p>Like in all company products, Apple have achieved again a perfect symbiosis between simplicity and power. For people who like go running this is a perfect gadget. Apart from the functions of a normal music player, it has some extra ones that make the difference. You can measure your distance or your pace, you have the information of pasts trainings stored and maybe the most important, you can inject some extra forces with the <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/index.jhtml?l=powersongs">PowerSong</a>. The PowerSong is only a song that you preset before go running and it's the song that makes you run faster or give you extra motivation.
Apart from the functions of the kit, there is a good community of runners. On Nike website of <a href="http://www.nikeplus.com/">Nike+</a> you can interact with the community and you can view your history. There are other interesting features like set goals and see if you can achieve them or challenge other runners to see who is the best.</p>
<p>To get this features up and running, you hace to tune your kit. The tune process consist on plug in the receiver in the Ipod and put the sensor in your Nike+ Shoes hole. For those who can't pay for a new shoes, like me, there are some solutions like <a href="http://www.marware.com/Sportsuit-Sensor-for-Gen-2-iPod-nano">buy an adapter</a> o make a homebrew hole inside your shoes reed.</p>
<p>For ending I have to say that the sensor doesn't have the possibility of changing this battery but Apple people says that the sensor's battery should outlast five pairs of running shoes. Would it be true?</p>

          <p>In the developing process of applications that are not as small as the typical "Hello, World!" examples, there are a variety of factors than can lead to important time savings.</p>

<p>There's a lot of documentation out there on how to design and specify application before the coding process starts, but there is a crucial factor on success that is not usually spoken of: the way you manage, create and edit your source files.</p>

<p>And of course there are some beautiful software pieces to help developers in that process. They're called IDEs (Integrated Development Environment).</p>

<p>The problem with most of those IDEs is that they offer so many options that you usually have to read a user's manual to really take the best from them. Ok, this is something normal, you might say. Maybe you're right, but be honest, how many software user guides have you read in your life? And I'm not talking about the usual RTFM for a linux man page which can be 4 pages long at most. I'm talking about a user's manual of 500 pages. I haven't.</p>

<p>And that's the reason today I'll be talking about a nice feature I found on one of the most powerful IDEs out there (regardless of being from Microsoft): Visual Studio 2005 Code Snippets.</p>
