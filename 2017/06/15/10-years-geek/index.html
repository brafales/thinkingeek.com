  <title>10 years of Think In Geek</title>
  <meta name="description" content="10 years ago Bernat (brafales) started this blog. This is still his blog though he is a bit busy these days and he cannot publish as much as he wants. All in all, without his initiative this blog would not exist. As would not exist many of the posts I published here since 2012, when Bernat insisted that I should collaborate. I guess his persistence has somehow paid off :) Consider this post a very small celebration of those 10 years. Hopefully we will be able to celebrate many more years.">
