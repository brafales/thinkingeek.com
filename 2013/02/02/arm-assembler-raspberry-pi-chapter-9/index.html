    <p>
In previous chapters we learnt the foundations of ARM assembler: registers, some arithmetic operations, loads and stores and branches. Now it is time to put everything together and add another level of abstraction to our assembler skills: functions.
</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>Why functions?</h2>

<p>
Functions are a way to reuse code. If we have some code that will be needed more than once, being able to reuse it is a Good Thing™. This way, we only have to ensure that the code being reused is correct. If we repeated the code whe should verify it is correct at every point. This clearly does not scale. Functions can also get parameters. This way not only we reuse code but we can use it in several ways, by passing different parameters. All this magic, though, comes at some price. A function must be a a <em>well-behaved</em> citizen.
</p>

<h2>Do's and don'ts of a function</h2>

<p>
Assembler gives us a lot of power. But with a lot of power also comes a lot of responsibility. We can break lots of things in assembler, because we are at a very low level. An error and nasty things may happen. In order to make all functions behave in the same way, there are <em>conventions</em> in every environment that dictate how a function must behave. Since we are in a Raspberry Pi running Linux we will use the <abbr title="Procedure Call Standard for ARM Architecture®">AAPCS</abbr> (chances are that other ARM operating systems like RISCOS or Windows RT follow it). You may find this document in the ARM documentation website but I will try to summarize it in this chapter.
</p>

<h3>New special named registers</h3>

<p>
When discussing branches we learnt that <code>r15</code> was also called <code>pc</code> but we never called it <code>r15</code> anymore. Well, let's rename from now <code>r14</code> as <code>lr</code> and <code>r13</code> as <code>sp</code>. <code>lr</code> stands for <em><strong>l</strong>ink <strong>r</strong>egister</em> and it is the address of the instruction following the instruction that <em>called us</em> (we will see later what is this). <code>sp</code> stands for <em><strong>s</strong>tack <strong>p</strong>ointer</em>. The <em>stack</em> is an area of memory owned only by the current function, the <code>sp</code> register stores the top address of that stack. For now, let's put the stack aside. We will get it back in the next chapter.
</p>

<h3>Passing parameters</h3>

<p>
Functions can receive parameters. The first 4 parameters must be stored, sequentially, in the registers <code>r0</code>, <code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code> and <code>r3</code>. You may be wondering how to pass more than 4 parameters. We can, of course, but we need to use the stack, but we will discuss it in the next chapter. Until then, we will only pass up to 4 parameters.
</p>

<h3><q>Well behaved</q> functions</h3>

<p>
A function must adhere, at least, to the following rules if we want it to be AAPCS compliant.
</p>

<ul>
<li>A function should not make any assumption on the contents of the <code>cpsr</code>. So, at the entry of a function condition codes N, Z, C and V are unknown.</li>
<li>A function can freely modify registers <code>r0</code>, <code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code> and <code>r3</code>.</li>
<li>A function cannot assume anything on the contents of <code>r0</code>, <code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code> and <code>r3</code> unless they are playing the role of a parameter.</li>
<li>A function can freely modify <code>lr</code> but the value upon entering the function will be needed when leaving the function (so such value must be kept somewhere).</li>
<li>A function can modify all the remaining registers as long as their values are restored upon leaving the function. This includes <code>sp</code> and registers <code>r4</code> to <code>r11</code>.</li>
This means that, after calling a function, we have to assume that (only) registers <code>r0</code>, <code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code>, <code>r3</code> and <code>lr</code> have been overwritten.&lt;/li&gt;
</ul>

<h3>Calling a function</h3>

<p>
There are two ways to call a function. If the function is statically known (meaning we know exactly which function must be called) we will use <code>bl label</code>. That label must be a label defined in the <code>.text</code> section. This is called a direct (or immediate) call. We may do indirect calls by first storing the address of the function into a register and then using <code>blx Rsource1</code>.
</p>

<p>
In both cases the behaviour is as follows: the address of the function (immediately encoded in the <code>bl</code> or using the value of the register in <code>blx</code>) is stored in <code>pc</code>. The address of the instruction following the <code>bl</code> or <code>blx</code> instruction is kept in <code>lr</code>.
</p>

<h3>Leaving a function</h3>

<p>
A well behaved function, as stated above, will have to keep the initial value of <code>lr</code> somewhere. When leaving the function, we will retrieve that value and put it in some register (it can be <code>lr</code> again but this is not mandatory). Then we will <code>bx Rsource1</code> (we could use <code>blx</code> as well but the latter would update <code>lr</code> which is useless here).
</p>

<h3>Returning data from functions</h3>

<p>
Functions must use <code>r0</code> for data that fits in 32 bit (or less). This is, C types <code>char</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code> (and <code>float</code> though we have not seen floating point yet) will be returned in <code>r0</code>. For basic types of 64 bit, like C types <code>long long</code> and <code>double</code>, they will be returned in <code>r1</code> and <code>r0</code>. Any other data is returned through the stack unless it is 32 bit or less, where it will be returned in <code>r0</code>.
</p>

<p>
In the examples in previous chapters we returned the error code of the program in <code>r0</code>. This now makes sense. C's <code>main</code> returns an <code>int</code>, which is used as the value of the error code of our program.
</p>

<h2>Hello world</h2>

<p>
Usually this is the first program you write in any high level programming language. In our case we had to learn lots of things first. Anyway, here it is. A "Hello world" in ARM assembler.
</p>

<p>
(Note to experts: since we will not discuss the stack until the next chapter, this code may look very dumb to you)

<p>
We are going to call <code>puts</code> function. This function is defined in the C library and has the following prototype <code>int puts(const char*)</code>. It receives, as a first parameter, the address of a C-string (this is, a sequence of bytes where no byte but the last is zero). When executed it outputs that string to <code>stdout</code> (so it should appear by default to our terminal). Finally it returns the number of bytes written.
</p>

<p>
We start by defining in the <code>.data</code> the label <code>greeting</code> in lines 4 and 5. This label will contain the address of our greeting message. GNU as provides a convenient <code>.asciz</code> directive for that purpose. This directive emits as bytes as needed to represent the string plus the final zero byte. We could have used another directive <code>.ascii</code> as long as we explicitly added the final zero byte.
</p>

<p>
After the bytes of the greeting message, we make sure the next label will be 4 bytes aligned and we define a <code>return</code> label in line 8. In that label we will keep the value of <code>lr</code> that we have in <code>main</code>. As stated above, this is a requirement for a well behaved function: be able to get the original value of <code>lr</code> upon entering. So we make some room for it.
</p>

<p>
The first two instructions, lines 14 an 15, of our main function keep the value of <code>lr</code> in that <code>return</code> variable defined above. Then in line 17 we prepare the arguments for the call to <code>puts</code>. We load the address of the greeting message into <code>r0</code> register. This register will hold the first (the only one actually) parameter of <code>puts</code>. Then in line 20 we call the function. Recall that <code>bl</code> will set in <code>lr</code> the address of the instruction following it (this is the instruction in line 23). This is the reason why we copied the value of <code>lr</code> in a variable in the beginning of the <code>main</code> function, because it was going to be overwritten by <code>bl</code>.
</p>

<p>
Ok, <code>puts</code> runs and the message is printed on the <code>stdout</code>. Time to get the initial value of <code>lr</code> so we can return successfully from main. Then we return.
</p>

<p>
Is our <code>main</code> function well behaved? Yes, it keeps and gets back <code>lr</code> to leave. It only modifies <code>r0</code> and <code>r1</code>. We can assume that <code>puts</code> is well behaved as well, so everything should work fine. Plus the bonus of seeing how many bytes have been written to the output.

<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$?</span>
12</code></pre></figure>


<p>
Note that "Hello world" is just 11 bytes (the final zero is not counted as it just plays the role of a finishing byte) but the program returns 12. This is because <code>puts</code> always adds a newline byte, which accounts for that extra byte.

<h2>Real interaction!</h2>

<p>
Now we have the power of calling functions we can glue them together. Let's call printf and scanf to read a number and then print it back to the standard output.

<p>
In this example we will ask the user to type a number and then we will print it back. We also return the number in the error code, so we can check twice if everything goes as expected. For the error code check, make sure your number is lower than 255 (otherwise the error code will show only its lower 8 bits).
</p>

<h2>Our first function</h2>

<p>
Let's define our first function. Lets extend the previous example but multiply the number by 5.

mult_by_5: 
    ldr r1, address_of_return2       /* r1 ← &amp;address_of_return */
    str lr, [r1]                     /* *r1 ← lr */

    add r0, r0, r0, LSL #2           /* r0 ← r0 + 4*r0 */

    ldr lr, address_of_return2       /* lr ← &amp;address_of_return */
    ldr lr, [lr]                     /* lr ← *lr */
    bx lr                            /* return from main using lr */
address_of_return2 : .word return2
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>


<p>
This function will need another "<code>return</code>" variable like the one <code>main</code> uses. But this is for the sake of the example. Actually this function does not call another function. When this happens it does not need to keep <code>lr</code> as no <code>bl</code> or <code>blx</code> instruction is going to modify it. If the function wanted to use <code>lr</code> as the the <code>r14</code> general purpose register, the process of keeping the value would still be mandatory.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, once the function has computed the value, it is enough keeping it in <code>r0</code>. In this case it was pretty easy and a single instruction was enough.
</p>

<p>
The whole example follows.

<p>
I want you to notice lines 58 to 62. There we prepare the call to <code>printf</code> which receives three parameters: the format and the two integers referenced in the format. We want the first integer be the number entered by the user. The second one will be that same number multiplied by 5. After the call to <code>mult_by_5</code>, <code>r0</code> contains the number entered by the user multiplied by 5. We want it to be the third parameter so we move it to <code>r2</code>. Then we load the value of the number entered by the user into <code>r1</code>. Finally we load in <code>r0</code> the address to the format message of <code>printf</code>. Note that here the order of preparing the arguments of a call is nonrelevant as long as the values are correct at the point of the call. We use the fact that we will have to overwrite <code>r0</code>, so for convenience we first copy <code>r0</code> to <code>r2</code>.
</p>
