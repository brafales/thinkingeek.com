Several times, in earlier chapters, I stated that the ARM architecture was designed with the embedded world in mind. Although the cost of the memory is everyday lower, it still may account as an important part of the budget of an embedded system. The ARM instruction set has several features meant to reduce the impact of code size. One of the features which helps in such approach is <strong>predication</strong>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Predication</h2>
<p>
We saw in chapters 6 and 7 how to use branches in our program in order to modify the execution flow of instructions and implement useful control structures. Branches can be unconditional, for instance when calling a function as we did in chapters 9 and 10, or conditional when we want to jump to some part of the code only when a previously tested condition is met.
</p>
<p>
Predication is related to conditional branches. What if, instead of branching to some part of code meant to be executed only when a condition <code>C</code> holds, we were able to <em>turn</em> some instructions <em>off</em> when that <code>C</code> condition does not hold?. Consider some case like this.
</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="nf">E</span><span class="p">();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
Using predication (and with some invented syntax to express it) we could write the above if as follows.
</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">P</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">P</span><span class="p">]</span>  <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">P</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">E</span><span class="p">();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
This way we avoid branches. But, why would be want to avoid branches? Well, executing a conditional branch involves a bit of uncertainty. But this deserves a bit of explanation.
</p>

<h3>The assembly line of instructions</h3>

<p>
Imagine an assembly line. In that assembly line there are 5 workers, each one fully specialized in a single task. That assembly line <em>executes</em> instructions. Every instruction enters the assembly line from the left and leaves it at the right. Each worker does some task on the instruction and passes to the next worker to the right. Also, imagine all workers are more or less synchronized, each one ends the task in as much <code>6</code> seconds. This means that at every 6 seconds there is an instruction leaving the assembly line, an instruction fully executed. It also means that at any given time there may be up to 5 instructions being processed (although not fully executed, we only have one fully executed instruction at every 6 seconds).
</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pipeline.png" alt="The assembly line of instructions" width="537" height="124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803" /></p>

<p>
The first worker <em>fetches</em> instructions and puts them in the assembly line. It fetches the instruction at the address specified by the register <code>pc</code>. By default, unless told, this worker <em>fetches</em> the instruction physically following the one he previously fetched (this is <em>implicit sequencing</em>).
</p>

<p>
In this assembly line, the worker that checks the condition of a conditional branch is not the first one but the third one. Now consider what happens when the first worker fetches a conditional branch and puts it in the assembly line. The second worker will process it and pass it to the third one. The third one will process it by checking the condition of the conditional branch. If it does not hold, nothing happens, the branch has no effect. But if the condition holds, the third worker must notify the first one that the next instruction fetched should be the instruction at the address of the branch.
</p>

<p>
But now there are two instructions in the assembly line that should not be fully executed (the ones that were physically after the conditional branch). There are several options here. The third worker may pick two stickers labeled as <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">do nothing</span>, and stick them to the two next instructions. Another approach would be the third worker to tell the first and second workers «hey guys, stick a <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">do nothing</span> to your current instruction». Later workers, when they see these <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">do nothing</span> stickers will do, huh, nothing. This way each <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">do nothing</span> instruction will never be fully executed. 
</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bombolla.png" alt="The third worker realizes that a branch is taken. Next two instructions will get a DO NOTHING sticker" width="535" height="556" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821" /></p>

<p>
But by doing this, that nice property of our assembly line is gone: now we do not have a fully executed instruction every 6 seconds. In fact, after the conditional branch there are two <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">do nothing</span> instructions. A program that is constantly doing branches may well reduce the performance of our assembly line from one (useful) instruction each 6 seconds to one instruction each 18 seconds. This is three times slower!
</p>

<p>
Truth is that modern processors, including the one in the Raspberry Pi, have <em>branch predictors</em> which are able to mitigate these problems: they try to predict whether the condition will hold, so the branch is taken or not. Branch predictors, though, predict the future like stock brokers, using the past and, when there is no past information, using some sensible assumptions. So branch predictors may work very well with relatively predictable codes but may work not so well if the code has unpredictable behaviour. Such behaviour, for instance, is observed when running decompressors. A compressor reduces the size of your files removing the redundancy. Redundant stuff is predictable and can be omitted (for instance in "he is wearing his coat" you could ommit "he" or replace "his" by "its", regardless of whether doing this is rude, because you know you are talking about a male). So a decompressor will have to decompress a file which has very little redundancy, driving nuts the predictor.
</p>

<p>
Back to the assembly line example, it would be the first worker who attempts to predict where the branch will be taken or not. It is the third worker who verifies if the first worker did the right prediction. If the first worker mispredicted the branch, then we have to apply two stickers again and notify the first worker which is the right address of the next instruction. If the first worker predicted the branch right, nothing special has to be done, which is great.
</p>

<p>
If we avoid branches, we avoid the uncertainty of whether the branch is taken or not. So it looks like that predication is the way to go. Not so fast. Processing a bunch of instructions that are actually turned off is not an efficient usage of a processor.
</p>

<p>
Back to our assembly line, the third worker will check the predicate. If it does not hold, the current instruction will get a <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">do nothing</span> sticker but in contrast to a branch, it does not notify the first worker.
</p>

<p>
So it ends, as usually, that no approach is perfect on its own.
</p>

<h2>Predication in ARM</h2>

<p>
In ARM, predication is very simple to use: almost all instructions can be predicated. The predicate is specified as a suffix to the instruction name. The suffix is exactly the same as those used in branches in the chapter 5: <code>eq</code>, <code>neq</code>, <code>le</code>, <code>lt</code>, <code>ge</code> and <code>gt</code>. Instructions that are not predicated are assumed to have a suffix <code>al</code> standing for <em><strong>al</strong>ways</em>. That predicate always holds and we do not write it for economy (it is valid though). You can understand conditional branches as predicated branches if you feel like.
</p>

<h2>Collatz conjecture revisited</h2>

<p>
In chapter 6 we implementd an algorithm that computed the length of the sequence of Hailstone of a given number. Though not proved yet, no number has been found that has an infinite Hailstone sequence. Given our knowledge of functions we learnt in chapters 9 and 10, I encapsulated the code that computes the length of the sequence of Hailstone in a function.

<h2>Adding predication</h2>

<p>
Ok, let's add some predication. There is an <em>if-then-else</em> construct in lines 22 to 31. There we check if the number is even or odd. If even we divide it by 2, if even we multiply it by 3 and add 1. 
</p>

    bne collatz_odd            /* if r2 != 0 (this is r1 % 2 != 0) branch to collatz_odd */

    add r1, r1, r1, LSL #1     /* r1 ← r1 + (r1 &lt;&lt; 1). This is r1 ← 3*r1 */

<p>
Note in line 24 that there is a <code>bne</code> (<strong>b</strong>ranch if <strong>n</strong>ot <strong>e</strong>qual). We can use this condition (and its opposite <code>eq</code>) to predicate this <em>if-then-else</em> construct. Instructions in the <em>then</em> part will be predicated using <code>eq</code>, instructions in the <em>else</em> part will be predicated using <code>ne</code>. The resulting code is shown below.
</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">    cmp r2, #0                 /* compare r2 and 0 */
    moveq r1, r1, ASR #1       /* if r2 == 0, r1 ← r1 &gt;&gt; 1. This is r1 ← r1/2 */
    addne r1, r1, r1, LSL #1   /* if r2 != 0, r1 ← r1 + (r1 &lt;&lt; 1). This is r1 ← 3*r1 */
    addne r1, r1, #1           /* if r2 != 0, r1 ← r1 + 1. */</code></pre></figure>

<p>
As you can se there are no labels in the predicated version. We do not branch now so they are not needed anymore. Note also that we actually removed two branches: the one that branches from the condition test code to the <em>else</em> part and the one that branches from the end of the <em>then</em> part to the instruction after the whole <em>if-then-else</em>. This leads to a more compact code.
</p>

<h2>Does it make any difference in performance?</h2>

<p>
Taken as is, this program is very small to be accountable for time, so I modified it to run the same calculation inside the collatz function 4194304 (this is 2<sup>22</sup>) times. I chose the number after some tests, so the execution did not take too much time to be a tedium.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, while the Raspberry Pi processor provides some hardware performance counters I have not been able to use any of them. <code>perf</code> tool (from the package <code>linux-tools-3.2</code>) complains that the counter cannot be opened.
</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nv">$ </span>perf_3.2 <span class="nb">stat</span> <span class="nt">-e</span> cpu-cycles ./collatz02

  Fatal: Not all events could be opened</code></pre></figure>

<p>
<code>dmesg</code> does not provide any additional information. We can see, though, that the performance counters was loaded by the kernel.
</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nv">$ </span>dmesg | <span class="nb">grep </span>perf
<span class="o">[</span>    0.061722] hw perfevents: enabled with v6 PMU driver, 3 counters available</code></pre></figure>

<p>
Supposedly I should be able to measure up to 3 hardware events at the same time. I think the Raspberry Pi processor, packaged in the BCM2835 SoC does not provide a PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit) which is required for performance counters. Nevertheless we can use <code>cpu-clock</code> to measure the time.
</p>

<p>
Below are the versions I used for this comparison. First is the branches version, second the predication version.

The tool <code>perf</code> can be used to gather performance counters. We will run 5 times each version. We will use number 123. We redirect the output of <code>yes 123</code> to the standard input of our tested program. This way we do not have to type it (which may affect the timing of the comparison).

<p>
So the answer is, yes. In <strong>this case</strong> it does make a difference. The predicated version runs 1,44 times faster than the version using branches. It would be bold, though, to assume that in general predication outperforms branches. Always measure your time.
