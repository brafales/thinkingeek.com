    <p>In chapter 10 we saw the basics to call a function. In this chapter we will cover more topics related to functions.</p>

<h2>Passing data to functions</h2>

<p>We already know how to call a function and pass them parameters. We also know how to return data from a function. Nevertheless, there are some issues which we have not fully solved yet.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Passing large amounts of data</li>
    <li>Returning more than one piece of data</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several ways to tackle this problem, but most of them involve pointers. Pointers are dreaded by many people, who do not fully understand them, but they are a crucial part in the way computers work. That said, most of the troubles with pointers are actually related to <em>dynamic memory</em> rather than the pointers themselves. We will not consider dynamic memory here.</p>

<h2>So what is a pointer?</h2>

<p>A pointer is some location in the memory the contents of which are simply an address of the memory.</p>

<p>This definition may be confusing, but we have already been using pointers in previous chapters. It is just that we did not name them this way. We usually talked about <em>addresses</em> and/or labels in the assembler. Consider this very simple program:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">/* first_pointer.s */

.data

.align 4
number_1  : .word 3

.text
.globl main

main:
    ldr r0, pointer_to_number    /* r0 ← &amp;number */
    ldr r0, [r0]                 /* r0 ← *r0. So r0 ← number_1 */

    bx lr

pointer_to_number: .word number_1</code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see, I deliberatedly used the name <code>pointer_to_number</code> to express the fact that this location in memory is actually a pointer. It is a pointer to <code>number_1</code> because it holds its address.</p>

<p>Imagine we add another number, let’s call it <code>number_2</code> and want <code>pointer_to_number</code> to be able to point to <code>number_2</code>, this is, contain the address of <code>number_2</code> as well. Let’s make a first attempt.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">.data

.align 4
number_1  : .word 3
number_2  : .word 4

.text
.globl main

main:
    ldr r1, address_of_number_2  /* r1 ← &amp;number_2 */
    str r1, pointer_to_number    /* pointer_to_number ← r1, this is pointer_to_number ← &amp;number_2 */

    bx lr

pointer_to_number: .word number_1
address_of_number_2: .word number_2</code></pre></figure>

<p>But if you run this you will get a rude <code>Segmentation fault</code>. We cannot actually modify <code>pointer_to_number</code> because, even if it is a location of memory that contains an address (and it would contain another address after the store) it is not in the <code>data</code> section, but in the <code>text</code> section. So this is a statically defined pointer, whose value (i.e. the address it contains) cannot change. So, how can we have a pointer that can change? Well, we will have to put it in the <code>data</code> section, where we usually put all the data of our program.</p>

                             /* r0 ← &amp;pointer_to_number */

    ldr r1, addr_of_number_2 /* r1 ← &amp;number_2 */

    str r1, [r0]             /* *r0 ← r1.
                                This is actually
                                  pointer_to_number ← &amp;number_2 */

    ldr r1, [r0]             /* r1 ← *r0.
                                This is actually
                                  r1 ← pointer_to_number
                                Since pointer_to_number has the value &amp;number_2
                                then this is like
                                  r1 ← &amp;number_2
                             */


    ldr r0, [r1]             /* r0 ← *r1
                                Since r1 had as value &amp;number_2
                                then this is like
                                   r0 ← number_2
                             */

    bx lr

addr_of_number_1: .word number_1
addr_of_number_2: .word number_2
addr_of_pointer_to_number: .word pointer_to_number
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>From this last example several things should be clear. We have static pointers to <code>number_1</code>, <code>number_2</code> and <code>pointer_to_number</code> (respectively called <code>addr_of_number_1</code>, <code>addr_of_number_2</code> and <code>addr_of_pointer_to_number</code>). Note that <code>addr_of_pointer_to_number</code> is actually a pointer to a pointer! Why these pointers are statically defined? Well, we can name locations of memory (i.e. addresses) using labels (this way we do not have to really know the exact address and at the same time we can use a descriptive name). These locations of memory, named through labels, will never change during the execution of the program so they are somehow predefined before the program starts. This why the addresses of <code>number_1</code>, <code>number_2</code> and <code>addr_of_pointer_to_number</code> are statically defined and stored in a part of the program that cannot change (the <code>.text</code> section cannot be modified when the program runs).</p>

<p>This means that accessing to <code>pointer_to_number</code> using <code>addr_of_pointer_to_number</code> involves using a pointer to a pointer. Nothing fancy here, a pointer to a pointer is just a location of memory that contains the address of another location of memory that we know is a pointer too.</p>

<p>The program simply loads the value 4, stored in <code>number_2</code> using <code>pointer_to_number</code>. We first load the address of the pointer (this is, the pointer to the pointer, but the <em>address of the pointer</em> may be clearer) into <code>r0</code> in line 13. Then we do the same with the address of <code>number_2</code>, storing it in <code>r1</code>, line 16. Then in line 18 we update the value <code>pointer_to_number</code> (remember, the value of a pointer will always be an address) with the address of <code>number_2</code>. In line 22 we actually get the value of <code>pointer_to_number</code> loading it into <code>r1</code>. I insist again: the value of <code>pointer_to_number</code> is an address, so now r1 contains an address. This is the reason why in line 31 we load into <code>r0</code> the value of the in <code>r1</code>.</p>

<h2>Passing large amounts of data</h2>

<p>When we pass data to functions we follow the conventions defined in the AAPCS. We try to fill the first 4 registers r0 to r3. If more data is expected we must use the stack. This means that if we were to pass a big chunk of data to a function we may end spending a lot of time just preparing the call (setting registers r0 to r3 and then pushing all the data on top of the stack, and remember, in reverse order!) than running the code of the function itself.</p>

<p>There are several cases when this situation arises. In a language like C, all parameters are passed by value. This means that the function receives a copy of the value. This way the function may freely modify this value and the caller will not see any changes in it. This may seem inefficient but from a productivity point of view, a function that does not cause any side effect to its inputs may be regarded as easier to understand than one that does.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">A</span>
<span class="p">{</span> 
  <span class="c1">// big structure</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="c1">// This function computes a 'thing_t' using a 'struct A'</span>
<span class="n">thing_t</span> <span class="nf">compute_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">my_code</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">thing_t</span> <span class="n">something</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">...;</span>
  <span class="n">something</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">compute_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c1">// a is unchanged here!</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that in C, array types are not passed by value but this is by design: there are no array values in C although there are array types (you may need to repeat to yourself this last sentence several times before fully understanding it ;)</p>

<p>If our function is going to modify the parameter and we do not want to see the changes after the call, there is little that we can do. We have to invest some time in the parameter passing.</p>

<p>But what if our function does not actually modify the data? Or, what if we are interested in the changes the function did? Or even better, what if the parameter being modified is actually another output of the function?</p>

<p>Well, all these scenarios involve pointers.</p>

<h2>Passing a big array by value</h2>

<p>Consider an array of 32-bit integers and we want to sum all the elements. Our array will be in memory, it is just a contiguous sequence of 32-bit integers. We want to pass, somehow, the array
to the function (together with the length of the array if the length may not be constant), sum all the integers and return the sum. Note that in this case the function does not modify the array it just reads it.</p>

<p>Let’s make a function <code>sum_array_value</code> that must have the array of integers passed by value. The first parameter, in <code>r0</code> will be the number of items of the integer array. Registers <code>r1</code> to <code>r3</code> may (or may not) have value depending on the number of items in the array. So the first three elements must be handled differently. Then, if there are still items left, they must be loaded from the stack.</p>

<p>The function is not particularly complex except for the special handling of the first 3 items (stored in <code>r1</code> to <code>r3</code>) and that we have to be careful when locating inside the stack the array. Upon entering the function the items of the array passed through the stack are laid out consecutively starting from <code>sp</code>. The <code>push</code> instruction at the beginning pushes onto the stack four registers (<code>r4</code>, <code>r5</code>, <code>r6</code> and <code>lr</code>) so our array is now in <code>sp + 16</code> (see lines 30 and 38). Besides of these details, we just loop the items of the array and accumulate the sum in the register <code>r4</code>. Finally, we move <code>r4</code> into <code>r0</code> for the return value of the function.</p>

<p>In order to call this function we have to put an array into the stack. Consider the following program.</p>

<p>In line 40 we start preparing the call to <code>sum_array_value</code>. The first parameter, passed in register <code>r0</code>, is the number of items of this array (in the example hardcoded to 256 items). Then we pass the first three items of the array in registers <code>r1</code> to <code>r3</code>. Remaining items must be passed on the stack. Remember that in a stack the last item pushed will be the first popped, so if we want our array be laid in the same order we have to push it backwards. So we start from the last item, line 53, and then we load every item and push it onto the stack. Once all the elements have been pushed onto the stack we can call <code>sum_array_value</code> (line 73).</p>

<p>An important caveat when manipulating the stack in this way is that it is very important to restore it and leave it in the same state as it was before preparing the call. This is the reason we keep <code>sp</code> in <code>r7</code> in line 49 and we restore it right after the call in line 76. Forgetting to do this will make further operations on the stack push data onto the wrong place or pop from the stack wrong data. Keeping the stack synched is essential when calling functions.</p>

<h2>Passing a big array by reference</h2>

<p>Now you are probably thinking that passing a big array through the stack (along with all the boilerplate that this requires) to a function that does not modify it, is, to say the least, wasteful.</p>

<p>Note that, when the amount of data is small, registers r0 to r3 are usually enough, so pass by value is affordable. Passing some data in the stack is fine too, but passing big structures on the stack may harm the performance (especially if our function is being called lots of times).</p>

<p>Can we do better? Yes. Instead of passing copies of the values of the array, would it be possible to pass the address to the array? The answer is, again, yes. This is the concept of <em>pass by reference</em>. When we pass by value, the value of the data passed is somehow copied (either in a register or a stack). Here we will pass a <em>reference</em> (i.e. an address) to the data. So now we are done by just passing the number of items and then the address of the array, and let the function use this address to perform its computation.</p>

<p>Consider the following program, which also sums an array of integers but now passing the array by reference.</p>

<p>Now the code is much simpler as we avoid copying the values of the array in the stack. We simply pass the address of the array as the second parameter of the function and
then we use it to access the array and compute the sum. Much simpler, isn’t it?</p>

<h2>Modifying data through pointers</h2>

<p>We saw at the beginning of the post that we could modify data through pointers. If we pass a pointer to a function we can let the function modify it as well. Imagine a function that takes an integer and increments its. We could do this by returning the value, for instance.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">increment:
    add r0, r0, #1  /* r0 ← r0 + 1 */</code></pre></figure>

<p>This takes the first parameter (in <code>r0</code>) increments it and returns it (recall that we return integers in <code>r0</code>).</p>

<p>An alternative approach, could be receiving a pointer to some data and let the function increment the data at the position defined by the pointer.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">increment_ptr:
  ldr r1, [r0]      /* r1 ← *r0 */
  add r1, r1, #1    /* r1 ← r1 + 1 */
  str r1, [r0]      /* *r0 ← r1 */</code></pre></figure>

<p>For a more elaborated example, let’s retake the array code but this time instead of computing the sum of all the values, we will multiply each item by two and keep it in the same array. To prove that we have modified it, we will also print each item.</p>

<h2>Returning more than one piece of data</h2>

<p>Functions, per the AAPCS convention, return their values in register <code>r0</code> (and <code>r1</code> if the returned item is 8 bytes long). We can return more than one thing if we just pass a pointer to some storage (possibly in the stack) as a parameter to the function. More on this topic in a next chapter.</p>

<p>That’s all for today.</p>
