    <p>A colleague of mine spent some time chasing a bug in a C++ library related
to concurrency.</p>

<p>At the end it all boiled down to a silly declaration that wasn’t one.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1>RAII</h1>

<p>There is a salient feature of C++ called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization
(RAII) in which it is possible to bind resource lifetimes to the lifetime of
declarations in C++.</p>

<p>This is very useful because the C++ object model guarantees that objects are
destroyed when the scope in which they were declared ends. This way it is
possible to acquire the resource in the constructor and release it in the
destructor. This is even more useful in the presence of exceptions, whose
unusual control flow is often the source of resources not beeing released under
exceptional flows. Because it ties resources to lifetimes of objects and given
that C++ gives guarantees regarding destruction of objects when exceptions are
thrown, makes RAII a very convenient and practical technique.</p>

<p>However there are still some confusing cases due to the C++ syntax, which is
sometimes surprising.</p>

<h2>Temporaries</h2>

<p>There is a number of situations in which a temporary needs to be created
in a C++ program. A common one is when we bind a reference to a prvalue.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">A</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">explicit</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">quux</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">};</span>
  <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Because passing arguments is modeled in the same way as initialization, a
similar case is as follows.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">bar</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">});</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Temporaries are in general destroyed when they are not needed any longer. In
the call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> above this happens at the end of the expression (conceptually
at the semicolon).</p>

<p>However, in the first case, we don’t want the references <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code> to point
to objects that have been freed. So in that case (and a number of others) the
lifetime of the temporary is extended such that the temporary is destroyed when
the reference goes out of scope.</p>

<h1>Locks</h1>

<p>C++ has a concurrency primitive class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::mutex</code> that is used to implement
mutual exclusion between threads. Often mutexes are of interest to link to
scopes, hence using them as RAII. For that purpose there are the classes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::lock_guard</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::scoped_lock</code>.</p>

<p>A common way to acquire a lock for the duration of a scope is as follows.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="cp">#include &lt;mutex&gt;
</span>
<span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mutex</span> <span class="n">protect_resource</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">critical</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">lock_guard</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mutex</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">l</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">protect_resource</span><span class="p">};</span>
     <span class="c1">// Do something with the resource that cannot</span>
     <span class="c1">// be accessed concurrently by threads.</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="c1">// The lock is released here.</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>My colleague was using this idiom, so what was wrong for him? Well, as usually
he <em>thought</em> he was using the idiom, instead the code looked like this.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="cp">#include &lt;mutex&gt;
</span>
<span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mutex</span> <span class="n">protect_resource</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">critical</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">lock_guard</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mutex</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">protect_resource</span><span class="p">};</span>
     <span class="c1">// ...</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I hope you can see the problem here, the lock is acquired and released
immediately upon destruction of the temporary. Part of the problem is that RAII
involves a declaration. It often happens that the name of the declaration is
not relevant, hence one might accidentally omit it. Unfortunately, in one of
those typical C++ syntactic flukes, we end not having a declaration anymore:
we’re creating a temporary.</p>

<p>It looks like this case is almost always an error. I fail to see what is the
usefulness of acquiring a lock to just release it afterwards. So, barring
memory ordering consequences, this is just an expensive no-operation.</p>

<p>Finally note that there is a convoluted case where this syntax might be OK.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="cp">#include &lt;mutex&gt;
</span>
<span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mutex</span> <span class="n">protect_resource</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">critical</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="k">const</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">lock_guard</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mutex</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">protect_resource</span><span class="p">};</span>
     <span class="c1">// ...</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But we will happily ignore that one, because frankly, a code like this serves
no favour to the reader. And code is more often read than written.</p>

<p>There is still a case where we could argue that this idiom is iseful. Class
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::scoped_lock</code> allows locking more than one lock at a time. So if we manage
to acquire all of them (even if we release all of them immediately) we may know
that the protected resources were at some point available. For instance we could
log that fact, but the logging process itself may not demand exclusive access
to the processes. However it is always possible to write something like this.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">idleness</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">scoped_lock</span> <span class="n">l</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">m_resource1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">m_resource2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">m_resource3</span><span class="p">};</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="n">mylog</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">"All resources available at timestamp: "</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">get_timestamp</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>More wordy, yes, but an unusual usage that we can still reduce to the syntax of
the usual case.</p>

<h1>Attributes</h1>

<p>Given a user-defined class that we can modify, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> above, its
constructors can be marked with the standard attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nodiscard</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">A</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">nodiscard</span><span class="p">]]</span> <span class="k">explicit</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">quux</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">};</span> <span class="c1">// Emits a warning.</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However we cannot do that with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::lock_guard</code> as it is a class that is
defined by the C++ library and it may not include such annotation (it may not
be desirable to introduce false positives in some of the unusual cases).</p>

<h1>Linting with clang-tidy</h1>

<p>One thing we can do is use a linting tool such as <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang-tidy</code></a>. This
clang-based tool provides a practical mechanism to add new diagnostics. Most
checks are designed around <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchers.html">the clang ASTMatcher library</a> that is very
convenient to match clang ASTs.</p>

<h2>Adding a new check</h2>

<p>Let’s see how we can add a check to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang-tidy</code>. In this post we will see
the basics, <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/Contributing.html">so check the documentation for greater details</a>.</p>

<p>First let’s define a header inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">concurrency</code> namespace. There are a few
namespaces but this one feels right for our purpose.</p>

<p>Member function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">registerMatcher</code> will
register the matcher (or matchers) that will then be passed onto function
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check</code>. These use the ASTMatcher library, which is very powerful, but basically
we say: match all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CXXTemporaryObjectExpr</code> nodes (we’ll see below why) using the
matcher constructor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cxxTemporaryObjectExpr</code>. But of those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CXXTemporaryObjectExpr</code>,
only match those that appear in the main file (not in a header) and they are
trying to construct a type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt;</code>. Finally bind a node that
matches all these properties to the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uselesslock</code>.</p>

<p>Once a node matches it is passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check</code>. Here we can do some additional
filtering if that can’t easily be expressed using matchers. We don’t have to do
anything like that so we just diagnose that the lock is useless.</p>

<p>Finally, the required plumbing to compile and register the check follows (in
diff format for clarity).</p>

<p>Now we can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang-tidy</code>, enabling explicitly our new check (ignore the

<p>Voilà, here we have our new diagnostic. Now we can add this to CI if needed.
At this point I’ll stop but we can extend it with a fix-it (so clang suggests
how to ammend the issue).</p>

<h2>How do we know what to match?</h2>

<p>There are two mechanisms here. First we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang-query</code> which allows us
to use the C++ syntax in a REPL-like tool. But before we can know what we want
to match we may need to see the AST as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang</code> represents it. We can do that
doing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-Xclang -ast-dump</code>.</p>

<p>In the example above</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>clang <span class="nt">-Xclang</span> <span class="nt">-ast-dump</span> <span class="nt">-fsyntax-only</span> t.cc</code></pre></figure>

<p>This prints a giant tree, after all header <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mutex</code> will include lots of things,
but the interesting bits are at the end.</p>

<p>As you can see this is a representation of our function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">critical</code>. It has two
compound statements of which we care about the one including that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CXXTemporaryObjectExpr</code>. This is exactly the node we matched above in the
matcher. To avoid matching other things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A{3}</code> we need to ensure the
expression has type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt;</code>, again a fact we stated in
the matcher.</p>

<p>Cool right? 😃</p>
